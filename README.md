# SchoolMoney (backend)

SchoolMoney is a platform designed to simplify school payments. Parents can top up their account via Stripe and receive a balance in their digital wallet. They can then create a school class, becoming the class treasurer, while other parents can contribute payments for their own children to funds created within the class. Funds can be created by the class treasurer, and each parent can create their own class as well. The platform also automates refunds if a fund is cancelled.
